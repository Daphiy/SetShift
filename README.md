# SetShift

This is an implementation of a behavioural task with a questionnaire at the beginning and feedback questions at the end. 
If you want to asjust this code for your purposes (another behavioural task), feel free to contact me at daphiya@gmail.com

This behavioural task consists of two games : 
1. A variation of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, where one card has to be matched to one of 4 piles 
2. A similiar task but with two cards, where the goal is to determine if they match or not 

I implemented it in Unity, coding in C#.  

The code is in Assets\Scripts\SetShifting

The questionnaire and feedback questions are in Assets\Scripts\SetShifting\Data

The stimuli (different cards and instruction images) are in Assets\Sprites
